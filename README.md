# Django Project Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains documentation about a Django project, guiding users on how to create a Django app, detailing the files it contains, and providing a comprehensive detail of each part of a Django application.

## 1. Technologies Used

- **Backend and Frontend**: Django (with Django templates for frontend rendering)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Django's built-in authentication system
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap (for styling)
- **Database ORM**: Django ORM

## 2. Project Structure

Here is the high-level folder structure for the project:

```bash

## Project root files

When you create a new Django project, it generates a directory with several files and subdirectories.

`Manage.py`: A command-line utility for managing various aspects of the project, such as running the development server, applying migrations, and creating new apps.

`<project-name>`: This directory carries the name you provided when you created the project. Inside, you'll find:

`(a) 'settings.py'`: This file holds the project's configuration settings, including database configurations, installed apps, middleware, and more.

`(b) 'urls.py'`: The urls.py files define the URL patterns and their corresponding views. These patterns determine which view should be called when a particular URL is accessed.

`(c) 'wsgi.py' and 'asgi.py':` This file is used for deploying the Django project on a WSGI server and ASGI server respectively.

`(d) **init**.py:`` An empty file indicating that the directory should be treated as a Python package.

`requirements.txt`

When you run pip freeze > requirements.txt , you're essentially creating a file named requirements.txt that contains a list of all the installed packages and their versions in the current environment. This file can be shared with others, allowing them to replicate your environment by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

## What is a Django App?

A Django app is a self-contained component within a Django project that performs a specific functionality or serves a particular purpose. Apps can be reused across projects and are designed to be modular, making it easier to maintain and extend Django projects.

To create a django app

```py
cd project-directory-name
django-admin startapp myapp
```

This command will create a new directory named myapp containing the necessary files and folders for your Django app.

Let's take a closer look at each of these files and directories.

## File descriptions

1. **ini**.py
   The **init**.py file is an empty file that tells Python to treat the myapp directory as a Python package. It's not necessary to add any code to this file unless you want to perform additional setup when the app is imported.

2. admin.py
   The admin.py file is where you can register models to be managed via Django's built-in admin interface. You can define custom admin views, filters, and actions for your models in this file.

3. apps.py
   The apps.py file defines the configuration for the Django app. It includes metadata such as the app name, verbose name, and app configuration class.

4. migrations/
   The migrations/ directory contains database migration files generated by Django's migration system. Migrations are used to manage changes to the database schema over time.

5. models.py
   The models.py file is where you define the data models for your Django app. Each model represents a database table, and you can define fields, relationships, and methods on the models to interact with the database.

6. tests.py
   The tests.py file is where you write tests for your Django app using Django's testing framework. Writing tests helps ensure the correctness and reliability of your application.

7. views.py
   The views.py file contains the view functions or classes that handle HTTP requests and return HTTP responses. Views are the heart of a Django app and define the logic for rendering templates, processing form submissions, and interacting with models.

## app

an app is a self-contained module that encapsulates a specific piece of functionality or a related set of features within a larger project. Each app is designed to do one thing and do it well, making it easier to organize and maintain your code. Here are some key points about Django apps:

### Setup for the project

```sh
# install python and pip using Homebrew
brew install python

# install virtualenv using pip
python3 -m pip install virtualenv

# make a main directory
mkdir directory_name
cd directory_name

# create a new virtual environment
virtualenv env

# activate virtual environment (macOS)
source env/bin/activate

# add .gitignore and requirements.txt
touch .gitignore
touch requirements.txt

# install Django in the virtual environment
pip install django
pip install python-dotenv

# check if Django is installed
django-admin --version
#
pip install -r requirements.txt
# create a new Django project (corrected command)
django-admin startproject project_name

# go to the project directory
cd project_name

# create an app inside the project
django-admin startapp appname
# or
python manage.py startapp appname

# start the development server
python manage.py runserver
```

## servers

servers are computers that runs applications and services.
It provides service to the use and another computer.
They are stored in data centers, all of the servers are connected to the internet and running different applications.

Data centers are built based on the service purpose, for instance if it provides more content like images and videos, it will have more hard drive space.
these devices are called ` hardware` and the piece of code that run on them are known as `software`.

## web server

a web server commonly do the following tasks.

- website storage and administration
- data storage
- security
- managing emails
- responding ot web requests from the client

## webpage

a webpage is a document that displays image, videos, text and various content, it is a single page.

## website

a website is collection of webpages that are linked together.

## web application

web applications are more interactive where websites are more informative like `wikipedia`.

## page rendering

when the server sends the page content, the process of reading the code and creating the page on the screen is known page rendering.

## browser

It is a software that allows us to browse on world wide web.

## HTTP

a protocol that is used between the client(user) and the server.
it is used to transfer web resources like images, HTML, videos and so on.

## Library

A library supplies reusable pieces of code that we can use in our application instead of having to re-create the required code.
they are built for a specific purpose.
For instance a library for validating the emails.

## Framework

Frameworks provides the blueprint or structure to work with.
It defines flow and control of our application.

#### Advantages

- time saving
- structure
- best practices

in frameworks, we are having more freedom.

## API

application program interfaces that allows us to interact with an application.

## WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface)

WSGI is designed for synchronous applications. It operates in a blocking, request-response model, which means it handles one request at a time in a linear fashion

Usage: WSGI is widely used in frameworks like Django (before Django 3.0), Flask, and Pyramid. It works well for apps where I/O (like database queries or file reads) is not heavily concurrent.
Limitations: WSGI struggles with real-time applications like WebSockets or long-polling connections because of its blocking nature.

## ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface)

Asynchronous: ASGI is designed to handle both synchronous and asynchronous operations. It can manage long-lived connections and high-concurrency tasks, making it ideal for real-time apps like WebSockets, chat applications, or async API servers.

Usage: ASGI is used by frameworks like Django (3.0+ for async support), FastAPI, and Starlette. It provides support for WebSockets, HTTP2, and other modern protocols.
Flexibility: ASGI works well for both simple and complex use cases, enabling features like background tasks, WebSocket connections, and event-driven architectures.

### websocket

A WebSocket is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex (two-way) communication between a client (usually a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP, where the client requests data from the server and the server responds once, WebSocket allows both the client and server to send messages to each other at any time.
